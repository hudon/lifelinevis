        <h2>Tag propagation over time</h2>
        <p style="width:800px;">
            A tree node represents a process thread.
            An edge between two nodes represents communication between them.
            The parent is always the process that sends the tag,
            and the child is the receiving process.
            The tree nodes are placed in time buckets based on the time that the
            tag was sent from parent to child.
            Clicking on a tree node compresses all the descendants of the node.
            Hovering over a node highlights all the occurences of the process
            in the tree. Different threads of the same process are highlighted
            using a different color.
            The different colors of the edges indicate propagation of some
            specific tag (refer to the legend).

        <h2>Tag propagation graph</h2>
        <p style="width:800px;">
            A tree node represents a process thread.
            An edge between two nodes represents communication between them.
            The nodes can be moved to more convenient locations by clicking
            and dragging them. The different colors of the edges indicate
            propagation of some specific tag. Use the checkboxes at the bottom
            to isolate specific tags.
            <br> <b>NOTE:</b> data used for this graph is static at the moment,
            thus may vary from the tree data.

        <h2>Thread communication frequency matrix</h2>
        <p style="width:800px;">
            The processes listed on the left side of the graph are the source
            processes (send a tag). The processes on the top of the graph are
            the target processes (recieve a tag). The colored squares in the
            graph represent communication between the source and the target
            process. Hovering oher a square highlights the processes involved
            in the communication. The intensity of the colour represents the
            total interations (more intence means more interactions).
            <br> <b>NOTE:</b> Data used for this graph is static at the moment,
            thus may vary from the tree data.
            <br> <b>NOTE:</b> The 'Order' functionality does not yet have much
            semantic meaning in examining the data.

    <div>
        <h2>Total interations per process</h2>
        <p style="width:800px;">
            The x-axis contains a list of all the process threads that
            either sent or recieved tags. The y-axis measures the total number
            of interactions for the tread. The left stacked bar measures the
            number of tags sent by the process. The right stacked bar measures
            the number of tags recieved by the process. Different colors within
            the bar represent different tags. Clicking on the items in the legend
            either removes or adds the data item to the graph.
