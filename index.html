        <h2>Tag Propagation Graph</h2>
        <p style="width:800px;">
          Here, every process thread is a node. Edges are formed between
          nodes that have communicated with eachother.
        <p style="width:800px;">
          The different tags are shown as edges with different colors. These
          colors are the same as the ones used in the tree above for the same
          tags. Use the checkboxes below to show only certain tags.
        </p>
        <p style="width:800px;">
          Variations on this graph could include representing multiple
          connections through edge thickness as opposed to multiple edges and
          adding communication direction.

        <h2>Thread Communication Frequency Matrix</h2>
        <p style="width:800px;">
            The processes are listed on the vertical axis (sent a tag) and on
            the horizontal axis (received a tag).  The colored squares in the
            graph represent the amount of communication between the source and
            the target process. Hovering over a square highlights the
            processes involved in the communication.

        <h2>Total Interations Per Process</h2>
        <p style="width:800px;">
            The x-axis contains a list of all the process threads that
            either sent or recieved tags. The y-axis measures the total number
            of interactions for the tread. The left stacked bar measures the
            number of tags sent by the process. The right stacked bar measures
            the number of tags recieved by the process. Different colors within
            the bar represent different tags.
