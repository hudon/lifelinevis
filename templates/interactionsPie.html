<h3>Total Interations Per Thread</h3>

<p style="width:800px;">
The pie chart consists of all processes and their threads (or collapsed to
unique processes) that either sent or received tags. Each piece of the pie shows
the proportions of total communications done by the process or thread. The controls
below the chart can be used to change the mode and the interactions used to
create the chart.
