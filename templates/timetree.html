    <h2>Tag Propagation Over Time</h2>
    <p style="width:800px;">
        A tree node represents a process thread.  An edge between two
        nodes represents communication between them.  The parent is the
        process that sends the tag, and the child is the receiving
        process.  The tree nodes are placed in time buckets based on the
        time that the tag was received at. Thus, the time indicated at
        each node is the time at which a tag was received, not sent.
    </p>
    <p style="width:800px;">
      Here, real data is used after assigning a tag ("2") to firefox threads and
      waiting for a few seconds. One tag name was changed to "0" to show
      an example legend.

    Aside from visual enhancements, a worthwhile extension to the graph
    could be focusing on certain time periods (e.g. if there is one hour's
    worth of data, view only what happened during the 30th minute).
